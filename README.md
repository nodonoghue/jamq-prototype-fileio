# jamq-prototype-fileio

Simple prototype for file io operations as a learning tool and a first step towards a larger project.

Prototype will create a new file in the specified path with the contents of "Hello, world!"

Files will be named with the timestamp value of duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) in milliseconds.

This prototype explores several concepts, such as error handling, reading and writing to a file, and separating code into separate files using modules, and finally moving the modules into a different directory.
